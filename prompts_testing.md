### Pure textual instructions
1. 
    - System: `Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to atomic descriptions.`
    - User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
    - Outputs:
        ```
        1. The man begins in a neutral standing position with both arms at his sides.
        2. He bends both elbows slightly to prepare for the upward movement.
        3. Simultaneously, he begins to lift both arms laterally away from his body.
        4. As his arms rise, he keeps his elbows mostly extended but not locked, palms facing each other.
        5. He continues lifting his arms upward until they are fully extended and aligned vertically with his body.
        6. His hands reach above his head, and the palms may face slightly forward or towards each other.
        7. The final position has both arms straight and hands above the head.

    - System:
        ```
        Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to a structured combination of atomic descriptions.
        An atomic description specifies the movement of a certain body part in a certain time interval.
        ```
    - User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        To decompose the high-level instruction "A man raises both hands above the head" into structured, atomic descriptions, we need to specify each essential movement in terms of individual body parts (in this case, the hands and arms), along with respective time intervals. Weâ€™ll assume a simplified time interval for demonstration.

        1. **Initial Position:**
        - **Time: T0 to T1 **
        - **Description:** Man starts with both arms at his sides.

        2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T1 to T2**
        - **Description:** Man bends elbows, moving forearms from a vertical position beside the body to a horizontal position in front of the chest.

        3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T2 to T3**
        - **Description:** Keeping elbows bent, man lifts upper arms from hanging down at his sides to a position where they are level with his shoulders.

        4. **Full Arm Extension:**
        - **Time: T3 to T4**
        - **Description:** Man straightens elbows and extends both arms fully vertically above his head.

        These atomic descriptions cover the detailed movements involved in the action of raising both hands above the head, with each crucial step broken down into specific movements and associated time intervals.
        ```
    - User: `Recursively decompose each of the descriptions above which you think is not atomic enough.`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        To recursively decompose the above descriptions further into more atomic procedures, let's specify each key action involved in the smaller movements of each limb segment:

        1. **Initial Position:**
        - **Time: T0 to T1**
        - **Description:**
            - Arms straight, relaxed, and hanging by the sides of the body.
            - Palms facing the body.
            - Shoulders in a neutral, relaxed position.

        2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T1 to T2**
        - **Description:**
            - **Elbow Joint Movement:**
            - **Time: T1 to T1.5**
            - **Description:** Initiate movement by flexing the elbow joints, reducing the angle between the forearms and upper arms.
            - **Forearm Positioning:**
            - **Time: T1.5 to T2**
            - **Description:** Continue flexing the elbows until the forearms are parallel to the ground, hands in front of the chest, palms facing upwards.

        3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T2 to T3**
        - **Description:**
            - **Shoulder Joint Rotation:**
            - **Time: T2 to T2.5**
            - **Description:** Rotate the shoulder joints to lift the relaxed, bent arms, moving the upper arms to a position where they are horizontal and even with shoulders.
            - **Upper Arm Alignment:**
            - **Time: T2.5 to T3**
            - **Description:** Adjust the upper arms, ensuring they are aligned straight out from the shoulders, elbows bent at about 90-degrees, forearms pointing upwards.

        4. **Full Arm Extension:**
        - **Time: T3 to T4**
        - **Description:**
            - **Elbow Joint Extension:**
            - **Time: T3 to T3.5**
            - **Description:** Begin to extend the elbows, straightening the arms upward.
            - **Hand Positioning:**
            - **Time: T3.5 to T4**
            - **Description:** Fully extend the elbows until the arms are completely straight above the head, palms facing each other.

        Each of these further decomposed descriptions targets the individual joints and how they move throughout the process, avoiding the combination of multiple joints or complex actions within a single atomic instruction. This allows for a precise specification suitable for programming or detailed biomechanical analysis.

        Here's a refined tabular representation of all atomic motions breaking down the instruction "A man raises both hands above the head," specifying the time scale and body part scale for clarity and detail:
        ```
        | Time Interval | Body Part       | Movement Description                                 |
        |---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
        | T0 to T1      | Entire Body     | Body in a relaxed standing position, arms by sides.  |
        |               | Palms           | Facing the body.                                     |
        |               | Shoulders       | In a relaxed, neutral position.                      |
        | T1 to T1.5    | Elbows          | Begin flexing at the joints.                         |
        | T1.5 to T2    | Forearms        | Continue flexing elbows until forearms are parallel to the ground, palms facing upwards. |
        | T2 to T2.5    | Shoulders       | Rotate joints to lift arms to shoulder level.        |
        | T2.5 to T3    | Upper Arms      | Align straight out from shoulders, elbows at 90-degrees, forearms vertical. |
        | T3 to T3.5    | Elbows          | Begin extending joints, moving arms upward.          |
        | T3.5 to T4    | Arms (Full Extension) | Extend elbows fully until arms are straight above the head. |
        |               | Hands           | Palms facing each other above the head.              |
        
        ```
        This table focuses on specific body parts (like elbows, forearms, shoulders, and hands) and details their movements over prespecified time intervals, enhancing clarity and specificity for each phase of the motion. This format is helpful for precise movement assessments, biomechanical studies, or programming humanoid robots.

        ```
        To make each description even more atomic, especially helpful for precise animation tasks in a graphics engine, let's break down the movement of each arm into sub-components, focusing specifically on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, and further clarifying the orientations and rotations required at each step.

        Below is a refined tabular representation of the atomic descriptions for the body parts and respective movements, specified along two axes: time scale and body part. This table helps in visualizing the synchronization and specific timeline for each joint movement required to animate a man raising both hands above his head.
        ```
        | Time (s) | Body Part         | Initial Position              | Final Position                   | Movement Description                                 |

        This table provides clear and sequential details for animators, ensuring that each component of the motion is accounted for and happens at the precise time, perfect for detailed and accurate computer graphics animations. It simplifies tracking the progression of each part of the movement within a defined time frame.
        ```
#### Analysis
1. Currently I only ask the model to further recursively decompose in the second run, which indeed helps more fine-grained and atomic generation.
2. Refinement into a table helps clearer representation.

#### TODO
1. Try the methods with more complex motions
2. Design a looping mechanism to really enable recursively decomposition.
