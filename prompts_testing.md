    - System: `Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to atomic descriptions.`
    - User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
    - Outputs:
        ```
        1. The man begins in a neutral standing position with both arms at his sides.
        2. He bends both elbows slightly to prepare for the upward movement.
        3. Simultaneously, he begins to lift both arms laterally away from his body.
        4. As his arms rise, he keeps his elbows mostly extended but not locked, palms facing each other.
        5. He continues lifting his arms upward until they are fully extended and aligned vertically with his body.
        6. His hands reach above his head, and the palms may face slightly forward or towards each other.
        7. The final position has both arms straight and hands above the head.

        To decompose the high-level instruction "A man raises both hands above the head" into structured, atomic descriptions, we need to specify each essential movement in terms of individual body parts (in this case, the hands and arms), along with respective time intervals. Weâ€™ll assume a simplified time interval for demonstration.

        1. **Initial Position:**
        - **Time: T0 to T1 **
        - **Description:** Man starts with both arms at his sides.

        2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T1 to T2**
        - **Description:** Man bends elbows, moving forearms from a vertical position beside the body to a horizontal position in front of the chest.

        3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T2 to T3**
        - **Description:** Keeping elbows bent, man lifts upper arms from hanging down at his sides to a position where they are level with his shoulders.

        4. **Full Arm Extension:**
        - **Time: T3 to T4**
        - **Description:** Man straightens elbows and extends both arms fully vertically above his head.

        These atomic descriptions cover the detailed movements involved in the action of raising both hands above the head, with each crucial step broken down into specific movements and associated time intervals.
        ```
    - User: `Recursively decompose each of the descriptions above which you think is not atomic enough.`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        To recursively decompose the above descriptions further into more atomic procedures, let's specify each key action involved in the smaller movements of each limb segment:

        1. **Initial Position:**
        - **Time: T0 to T1**
        - **Description:**
            - Arms straight, relaxed, and hanging by the sides of the body.
            - Palms facing the body.
            - Shoulders in a neutral, relaxed position.

        2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T1 to T2**
        - **Description:**
            - **Elbow Joint Movement:**
            - **Time: T1 to T1.5**
            - **Description:** Initiate movement by flexing the elbow joints, reducing the angle between the forearms and upper arms.
            - **Forearm Positioning:**
            - **Time: T1.5 to T2**
            - **Description:** Continue flexing the elbows until the forearms are parallel to the ground, hands in front of the chest, palms facing upwards.

        3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
        - **Time: T2 to T3**
        - **Description:**
            - **Shoulder Joint Rotation:**
            - **Time: T2 to T2.5**
            - **Description:** Rotate the shoulder joints to lift the relaxed, bent arms, moving the upper arms to a position where they are horizontal and even with shoulders.
            - **Upper Arm Alignment:**
            - **Time: T2.5 to T3**
            - **Description:** Adjust the upper arms, ensuring they are aligned straight out from the shoulders, elbows bent at about 90-degrees, forearms pointing upwards.

        4. **Full Arm Extension:**
        - **Time: T3 to T4**
        - **Description:**
            - **Elbow Joint Extension:**
            - **Time: T3 to T3.5**
            - **Description:** Begin to extend the elbows, straightening the arms upward.
            - **Hand Positioning:**
            - **Time: T3.5 to T4**
            - **Description:** Fully extend the elbows until the arms are completely straight above the head, palms facing each other.

        Each of these further decomposed descriptions targets the individual joints and how they move throughout the process, avoiding the combination of multiple joints or complex actions within a single atomic instruction. This allows for a precise specification suitable for programming or detailed biomechanical analysis.

        |               | Palms           | Facing the body.                                     |
        |               | Shoulders       | In a relaxed, neutral position.                      |
        | T1 to T1.5    | Elbows          | Begin flexing at the joints.                         |
        | T1.5 to T2    | Forearms        | Continue flexing elbows until forearms are parallel to the ground, palms facing upwards. |
        | T2 to T2.5    | Shoulders       | Rotate joints to lift arms to shoulder level.        |
        | T2.5 to T3    | Upper Arms      | Align straight out from shoulders, elbows at 90-degrees, forearms vertical. |
        | T3 to T3.5    | Elbows          | Begin extending joints, moving arms upward.          |

4. Step-by-step recursion
    - System:
        ```
        Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to a structured combination of atomic descriptions that can potentially serve as programmatic inputs into a computer graphics engine without substantive modification.
        An atomic description specifies the movement of a certain body part in a certain time interval.
        ```
    - User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        1. **Set Initial Position**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Man starts in a neutral position.
        - **Body Part(s)**: Whole body
        - **Motion**: None, body is static

        2. **Movement of Arms**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Both arms move from resting along the sides of the body to above the head.
        - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
        - **Motion**: Arms lift laterally (away from the body, elbows straight), continue to move until the hands are above the head, palms facing forward or toward each other.

        3. **End Position**:
        - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
        - **Description**: The arms finish moving and remain stationary above the head.
        - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
        - **Motion**: Arms are stationary, held straight above the head.

        Each of these steps details the specific body parts involved, the nature of their movement, and the timing of these movements to enact the instructions of raising both hands above
        ```
    - User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        The description that is not atomic enough is the second point:

        **Movement of Arms**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Both arms move from resting along the sides of the body to above the head.
        - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
        - **Motion**: Arms lift laterally (away from the body, elbows straight), continue to move until the hands are above the head, palms facing forward or toward each other.

        This description covers the movement of two arms simultaneously, but for a more atomic approach, each arm's movement should be specified separately, even if they perform the same action simultaneously. This ensures that each motion can be individually adjusted or controlled if needed. Here's how you could break it down more atomically:

        **Movement of Left Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Left arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
        - **Body Part**: Left Arm
        - **Motion**: Lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continuing to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the right hand.

        **Movement of Right Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Right arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
        - **Body Part**: Right Arm
        - **Motion**: Lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continuing to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the left hand.

        This breakdown makes each atomic description more specific to an individual body part's movement, which is essential for granular control in animation or simulation in computer graphics.
        ```
    - User: `Write down all the atomic descriptions again`
    - Assistant:

        4. **End Position for Left Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
        - **Description**: The left arm finishes moving and remains stationary above the head.
        - **Body Part**: Left Arm
        - **Motion**: Arm is stationary, held straight above the head.

        5. **End Position for Right Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
        - **Description**: The right arm finishes moving and remains stationary above the head.
        - **Body Part**: Right Arm
        - **Motion**: Arm is stationary, held straight above the head.

        These descriptions keep the details specific and isolated to individual body parts, enhancing precision and control for animation programming or computer graphics simulations.
        ```
    - User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
    - Assistant:
        ```
        The description that is not atomic enough in the list provided is:

        1. **Set Initial Position for Whole Body**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Man starts in a neutral position.
        - **Body Part(s)**: Whole body
        - **Motion**: None, body is static

        This description lists "Whole body" as the body part, which covers multiple components (arms, legs, head, torso, etc.). For an atomic description, specific positioning or status of each major body part or section should be described separately if they could potentially require independent control or exhibit different states even when starting in a general 'neutral' pose. This is essential in more sophisticated graphic applications where fine control over each body part is necessary, such as in detailed character animations.

        Hereâ€™s how you could break it down more atomically:

        - **Initial Position of Torso**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Torso is upright in a relaxed posture.
        - **Body Part**: Torso
        - **Motion**: None, torso remains static.

        - **Initial Position of Left Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Left arm is hanging relaxed at the side.
        - **Body Part**: Left Arm
        - **Motion**: None, left arm remains static.

        - **Initial Position of Right Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Right arm is hanging relaxed at the side.
        - **Body Part**: Right Arm
        - **Motion**: None, right arm remains static.

        - **Initial Position of Legs**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Legs are straight with a slight gap between them, standing position.
        - **Body Part**: Legs
        - **Motion**: None, legs remain static.

        This adjustment makes each description more specific to an individual body part's initial state, providing granular control right from the start.

        ```
        Upon reviewing the atomic descriptions provided, all are quite specific and focus on individual body parts; however, the descriptions of the initial positions could potentially be considered not atomic enough if precision in every aspect is crucial. For example:

        **Initial Position of Legs**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Legs are straight with a slight gap between them, in a standing position.
        - **Body Part**: Legs
        - **Motion**: None, legs remain static.

        This description involves both legs as a single unit. In cases where absolute atomic specificity is needed (for example, in detailed animation or physiotherapy simulations), it might be necessary to describe the position of each leg separately, even if they start in nearly identical conditions. This would allow for individual leg movements to be defined independently in subsequent actions, which could be essential in scenarios involving asymmetrical leg movements.

        Here is how you could break it down more atomically:

        1. **Initial Position of Left Leg**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Left leg is straight, slightly apart from the right leg, weight evenly distributed, in a standing position.
        - **Body Part**: Left Leg
        - **Motion**: None, left leg remains static.

        2. **Initial Position of Right Leg**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
        - **Description**: Right leg is straight, slightly apart from the left leg, weight evenly distributed, in a standing position.
        - **Body Part**: Right Leg
        - **Motion**: None, right leg remains static.

        These modifications make each leg's position explicitly clear and independent, offering more control for animations or simulations that might later involve only one leg.

        Upon further inspection, each description given in the last message is quite atomic, as each isolates individual limb movements and static positions. All body parts, including each arm and leg, are treated independently with specific actions described for their movement from the initial to the final state.

        However, if we had to suggest an improvement for even greater atomicity or specificity, it could be in the detailing of the hand orientation and exact elbow articulation during the arm movements:

        6. **Movement of Left Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Left arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.
        - **Body Part**: Left Arm
        - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues moving until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or towards the right hand.
        - **Potential Improvement**: Specify elbow angle changes if not completely straight, and more precise hand orientation.

        7. **Movement of Right Arm**:
        - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
        - **Description**: Right arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.

        - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues moving until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or towards the left hand.
        - **Potential Improvement**: Define specific angle changes in the elbow and detailed description of the hand orientation through the motion.

        These improvements could provide details that might be relevant in animation for showing muscle flexion or other detailed movements that are critical for high fidelity animations, like in character animations for films or video games where such nuances could improve realism.

        All the descriptions provided in the revised list contain a high level of atomic detail, focusing on individual body parts and specifying their movements in a precise manner. Each body part's motion is described separately, including the nuances of limb orientation and motion dynamics, enhancing the atomicity needed for exacting animation or simulation tasks.

        However, if further precision was ever necessary, additional details could potentially be added regarding wrist movements or the specific angle measurements for elbow and knee joints during movements but from the descriptions provided:

        - **Movement of Left Arm** and **Movement of Right Arm** could potentially benefit from specifying the exact degree of elbow bending and increasing detail about wrist orientation (e.g., flexing or rotation) if required for even more detailed animation needs.

        Additionally, you might specify:
        - Head position and orientation during the movement since head pose can provide emotional cues or balance information.
        - Detailing the torso movement, if any, to account for balance adjustment as the arms raise, which often involves slight counter-movements.

        It seems these suggestions venture beyond the given scenarios, as the provided descriptions are adequately atomic for common practice in animation and motion capture applications. Continuously breaking down actions could go into subatomic levels such as muscle contractions or skin deformation, usually not necessary unless for highly specialized medical or biomechanical simulations.

        This table effectively distinguishes between the states and motions of each body part at specific time intervals. It could be used as a direct reference in various applications such as character rigging or animation programming in computer graphics software, ensuring each aspect of the motion is accounted for accurately.
        ```

#### Analysis
1. When I ask the model to further recursively decompose in the second run, I can get more fine-grained atomic generation.
2. Refinement into a table helps clearer representation.

#### TODO
1. Try the methods with more complex motions
2. Design a looping mechanism to really enable recursive decomposition.
