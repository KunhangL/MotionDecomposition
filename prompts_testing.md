### Pure textual instructions

#### Naive instruction 
- System: `Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to atomic descriptions.`
- User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
- Outputs:
    ```
    1. The man begins in a neutral standing position with both arms at his sides.
    2. He bends both elbows slightly to prepare for the upward movement.
    3. Simultaneously, he begins to lift both arms laterally away from his body.
    4. As his arms rise, he keeps his elbows mostly extended but not locked, palms facing each other.
    5. He continues lifting his arms upward until they are fully extended and aligned vertically with his body.
    6. His hands reach above his head, and the palms may face slightly forward or towards each other.
    7. The final position has both arms straight and hands above the head.

    ```
    To decompose the high-level instruction "A man raises both hands above the head" into structured, atomic descriptions, we need to specify each essential movement in terms of individual body parts (in this case, the hands and arms), along with respective time intervals. Weâ€™ll assume a simplified time interval for demonstration.

    1. **Initial Position:**
    - **Time: T0 to T1 **
    - **Description:** Man starts with both arms at his sides.

    2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
    - **Time: T1 to T2**
    - **Description:** Man bends elbows, moving forearms from a vertical position beside the body to a horizontal position in front of the chest.

    3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
    - **Time: T2 to T3**
    - **Description:** Keeping elbows bent, man lifts upper arms from hanging down at his sides to a position where they are level with his shoulders.

    4. **Full Arm Extension:**
    - **Time: T3 to T4**
    - **Description:** Man straightens elbows and extends both arms fully vertically above his head.

    These atomic descriptions cover the detailed movements involved in the action of raising both hands above the head, with each crucial step broken down into specific movements and associated time intervals.
    ```
- User: `Recursively decompose each of the descriptions above which you think is not atomic enough.`
- Assistant:
    ```
    To recursively decompose the above descriptions further into more atomic procedures, let's specify each key action involved in the smaller movements of each limb segment:

    1. **Initial Position:**
    - **Time: T0 to T1**
    - **Description:**
        - Arms straight, relaxed, and hanging by the sides of the body.
        - Palms facing the body.
        - Shoulders in a neutral, relaxed position.

    2. **Lower Arm Movement:**
    - **Time: T1 to T2**
    - **Description:**
        - **Elbow Joint Movement:**
        - **Time: T1 to T1.5**
        - **Description:** Initiate movement by flexing the elbow joints, reducing the angle between the forearms and upper arms.
        - **Forearm Positioning:**
        - **Time: T1.5 to T2**
        - **Description:** Continue flexing the elbows until the forearms are parallel to the ground, hands in front of the chest, palms facing upwards.

    3. **Upper Arm Movement:**
    - **Time: T2 to T3**
    - **Description:**
        - **Shoulder Joint Rotation:**
        - **Time: T2 to T2.5**
        - **Description:** Rotate the shoulder joints to lift the relaxed, bent arms, moving the upper arms to a position where they are horizontal and even with shoulders.
        - **Upper Arm Alignment:**
        - **Time: T2.5 to T3**
        - **Description:** Adjust the upper arms, ensuring they are aligned straight out from the shoulders, elbows bent at about 90-degrees, forearms pointing upwards.

    4. **Full Arm Extension:**
    - **Time: T3 to T4**
    - **Description:**
        - **Elbow Joint Extension:**
        - **Time: T3 to T3.5**
        - **Description:** Begin to extend the elbows, straightening the arms upward.
        - **Hand Positioning:**
        - **Time: T3.5 to T4**
        - **Description:** Fully extend the elbows until the arms are completely straight above the head, palms facing each other.

    Each of these further decomposed descriptions targets the individual joints and how they move throughout the process, avoiding the combination of multiple joints or complex actions within a single atomic instruction. This allows for a precise specification suitable for programming or detailed biomechanical analysis.

    | T2.5 to T3    | Upper Arms      | Align straight out from shoulders, elbows at 90-degrees, forearms vertical. |
    | T3 to T3.5    | Elbows          | Begin extending joints, moving arms upward.          |
    | T3.5 to T4    | Arms (Full Extension) | Extend elbows fully until arms are straight above the head. |
    |               | Hands           | Palms facing each other above the head.              |

#### Step-by-step recursive prompting
##### Simple motion 1
- System:
    ```
    Decompose this high-level motion instruction down to a structured combination of atomic descriptions that can potentially serve as programmatic inputs into a computer graphics engine without substantive modification.
    An atomic description specifies the movement of a certain body part in a certain time interval.
    ```
- User: `A man raises both hands above the head.`
- Assistant:
    ```
    1. **Set Initial Position**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Man starts in a neutral position.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Whole body
    - **Motion**: None, body is static

    2. **Movement of Arms**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Both arms move from resting along the sides of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arms lift laterally (away from the body, elbows straight), continue to move until the hands are above the head, palms facing forward or toward each other.

    3. **End Position**:
    - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
    - **Description**: The arms finish moving and remain stationary above the head.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arms are stationary, held straight above the head.

    Each of these steps details the specific body parts involved, the nature of their movement, and the timing of these movements to enact the instructions of raising both hands above
    ```
- User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
- Assistant:
    ```
    The description that is not atomic enough is the second point:

    **Movement of Arms**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Both arms move from resting along the sides of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Left Arm, Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arms lift laterally (away from the body, elbows straight), continue to move until the hands are above the head, palms facing forward or toward each other.

    This description covers the movement of two arms simultaneously, but for a more atomic approach, each arm's movement should be specified separately, even if they perform the same action simultaneously. This ensures that each motion can be individually adjusted or controlled if needed. Here's how you could break it down more atomically:

    **Movement of Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Left arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm
    - **Motion**: Lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continuing to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the right hand.

    **Movement of Right Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Right arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continuing to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the left hand.

    This breakdown makes each atomic description more specific to an individual body part's movement, which is essential for granular control in animation or simulation in computer graphics.
    ```

    Here are the atomic descriptions, revised to be more granular for each body part and action:

    1. **Set Initial Position for Whole Body**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Man starts in a neutral position.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Whole body
    - **Motion**: None, body is static

    2. **Movement of Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Left arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the right hand.

    3. **Movement of Right Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Right arm moves from resting along the side of the body to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues to move until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or toward the left hand.

    4. **End Position for Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
    - **Description**: The left arm finishes moving and remains stationary above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm

    - **Time Interval**: 1.5s to 2s
    - **Description**: The right arm finishes moving and remains stationary above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm is stationary, held straight above the head.

    These descriptions keep the details specific and isolated to individual body parts, enhancing precision and control for animation programming or computer graphics simulations.
    ```
- User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
- Assistant:
    ```
    The description that is not atomic enough in the list provided is:

    1. **Set Initial Position for Whole Body**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Man starts in a neutral position.
    - **Body Part(s)**: Whole body
    - **Motion**: None, body is static

    This description lists "Whole body" as the body part, which covers multiple components (arms, legs, head, torso, etc.). For an atomic description, specific positioning or status of each major body part or section should be described separately if they could potentially require independent control or exhibit different states even when starting in a general 'neutral' pose. This is essential in more sophisticated graphic applications where fine control over each body part is necessary, such as in detailed character animations.

    Hereâ€™s how you could break it down more atomically:

    - **Initial Position of Torso**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Torso is upright in a relaxed posture.
    - **Body Part**: Torso
    - **Motion**: None, torso remains static.

    - **Initial Position of Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Left arm is hanging relaxed at the side.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm
    - **Motion**: None, left arm remains static.

    - **Initial Position of Right Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Right arm is hanging relaxed at the side.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm
    - **Motion**: None, right arm remains static.

    - **Initial Position of Legs**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Legs are straight with a slight gap between them, standing position.
    - **Body Part**: Legs
    - **Motion**: None, legs remain static.

    This adjustment makes each description more specific to an individual body part's initial state, providing granular control right from the start.

    5. **Movement of Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Left arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues moving until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or towards the right hand.

    6. **Movement of Right Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Right arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues moving until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or towards the left hand.

    7. **End Position for Left Arm**:

    ```
- User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
- Assistant:
    ```
    Upon reviewing the atomic descriptions provided, all are quite specific and focus on individual body parts; however, the descriptions of the initial positions could potentially be considered not atomic enough if precision in every aspect is crucial. For example:

    **Initial Position of Legs**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Legs are straight with a slight gap between them, in a standing position.
    - **Body Part**: Legs
    - **Motion**: None, legs remain static.

    This description involves both legs as a single unit. In cases where absolute atomic specificity is needed (for example, in detailed animation or physiotherapy simulations), it might be necessary to describe the position of each leg separately, even if they start in nearly identical conditions. This would allow for individual leg movements to be defined independently in subsequent actions, which could be essential in scenarios involving asymmetrical leg movements.

    Here is how you could break it down more atomically:

    1. **Initial Position of Left Leg**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Left leg is straight, slightly apart from the right leg, weight evenly distributed, in a standing position.
    - **Body Part**: Left Leg
    - **Motion**: None, left leg remains static.

    2. **Initial Position of Right Leg**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0s to 0.1s
    - **Description**: Right leg is straight, slightly apart from the left leg, weight evenly distributed, in a standing position.
    - **Body Part**: Right Leg
    - **Motion**: None, right leg remains static.

    These modifications make each leg's position explicitly clear and independent, offering more control for animations or simulations that might later involve only one leg.
    ```

    - **Description**: Torso is upright in a relaxed posture.
    - **Body Part**: Torso

    Upon further inspection, each description given in the last message is quite atomic, as each isolates individual limb movements and static positions. All body parts, including each arm and leg, are treated independently with specific actions described for their movement from the initial to the final state.

    However, if we had to suggest an improvement for even greater atomicity or specificity, it could be in the detailing of the hand orientation and exact elbow articulation during the arm movements:

    6. **Movement of Left Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Left arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Left Arm
    - **Motion**: Arm lifts laterally (away from the body, elbow straight), continues moving until the hand is above the head, palm facing forward or towards the right hand.
    - **Potential Improvement**: Specify elbow angle changes if not completely straight, and more precise hand orientation.

    7. **Movement of Right Arm**:
    - **Time Interval**: 0.1s to 1.5s
    - **Description**: Right arm moves from hanging by the side to above the head.
    - **Body Part**: Right Arm

    ```
    All the descriptions provided in the revised list contain a high level of atomic detail, focusing on individual body parts and specifying their movements in a precise manner. Each body part's motion is described separately, including the nuances of limb orientation and motion dynamics, enhancing the atomicity needed for exacting animation or simulation tasks.

    However, if further precision was ever necessary, additional details could potentially be added regarding wrist movements or the specific angle measurements for elbow and knee joints during movements but from the descriptions provided:

    - **Movement of Left Arm** and **Movement of Right Arm** could potentially benefit from specifying the exact degree of elbow bending and increasing detail about wrist orientation (e.g., flexing or rotation) if required for even more detailed animation needs.

    Additionally, you might specify:
    - Head position and orientation during the movement since head pose can provide emotional cues or balance information.
    - Detailing the torso movement, if any, to account for balance adjustment as the arms raise, which often involves slight counter-movements.

    It seems these suggestions venture beyond the given scenarios, as the provided descriptions are adequately atomic for common practice in animation and motion capture applications. Continuously breaking down actions could go into subatomic levels such as muscle contractions or skin deformation, usually not necessary unless for highly specialized medical or biomechanical simulations.

    ```
- User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
- Assistant:
    ```
    Upon reviewing the most recent set of descriptions, they all appear to be sufficiently atomic for computer graphics animation purposes. Each body part's movement is specified with precise degrees, linear distances, or fixed positional values suitable for direct translation into programming code or animation keys in a 3D modeling software.

    All the specified descriptions cover movement detail in terms of distance (for the hip), degree (for the knees and ankles), and include instructions on maintaining those positions or states during the specified intervals. These are highly atomic, allowing for exact reproduction in a simulation or animation.

    If more exactness is needed for a certain application, additional details such as the exact speed profile (expressed in cm/sec or degrees/sec and its variation over time), or specifying ease-in and ease-out behaviors might be considered, but for most practical purposes in computer graphics, the current level of detail is adequate.

    Thus, each description currently provided is atomic enough for animation purposes:
    - The hip movement describes a precise linear distance.
    - The knee flexion specifies an exact angle.
    - The ankle dorsiflexion also quantifies the degree of movement.
    ```
- User: `Which description above is not atomic enough?`
- Assistant:
    ```
    Upon reviewing the descriptions again, each part of the squat motion (hip, knees, and ankles) is described with quantitative endpoints which should generally be sufficient for basic computer graphics animations. Each body part's movement specifies the extent and nature of the move, such as distance, angle, or degrees, which are pivotal for clear, realistic animation.

    Therefore, based on the level of detail specified:
    - Hip: precise vertical movement in cm.
    - Knees: specific angle to which they should bend.
    - Ankles: explicit increase in dorsiflexion measured in degrees.

    All these descriptions include enough atomic details for direct implementation into a computer graphics engine without the need for further breakdown. They address specific movements in clear, unambiguous terms necessary for creating believable character animations.

    Based on this, there are no further adjustments needed for atomicity within the provided scope. Each description sufficiently addresses the precision required for programming or animating a simple squat motion in typical graphics software.

    The description in Step 4 â€” **Launching the Jump (Initial Jump Phase)** â€” is not quite atomic enough for precise input into a computer graphics engine. It covers multiple movements in a single time interval, which could be better split into more granular details, particularly focusing on the interaction of different body parts and their specific movements. Hereâ€™s how it can be refined:

    **Step 4: Launching the Jump (Initial Jump Phase)** can be divided into two distinct sub-steps to make the action more atomic:

    1. **Initial Leg Extension**:
    - Time Interval: t3 to t3.5
    - Legs: Rapid extension of the hips and knees begins, thrusting the body upward. 
    - Arms: Begin pulling back to aid in upward momentum.
    - Torso: Starts to straighten in preparation for leaving the ground.

    2. **Full Extension and Arm Swing**:
    - Time Interval: t3.5 to t4
    - Legs: Complete the extension of knees and hips; toes flex to push off the ground as the body lifts off.
    - Arms: Rapidly swing upwards, reaching above the head to maximize jump height.
    - Torso: Fully aligns with legs to form a straight vertical line at the peak of the jump.

    By detailing these sub-steps separately, we provide clearer instructions for each movement phase, allowing for more precise programming and visualization in a computer graphics context. This decomposition ensures that each body motion is captured distinctly, facilitating realistic animation where timing and coordination of movements are crucial.

    Upon reviewing the detailed steps, the description in **Step 6: Mid-Air Phase** could be considered not atomic enough compared to the others. This step generally describes a state of being ("mid-air") but does not delineate specific actions that different body parts should undertake during the several moments of being airborne. For maximal clarity and effectiveness in animation programming, it's useful to describe in more detail what each body part does during the ascent, peak, and beginning descent of the jump. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

    **6. Mid-Air Phase (Ascent):**
    - **Time Interval:** t4 to t4.5
    - **Legs:** Maintain slight bend at knees and hips to stabilize the body.
    - **Arms:** Reach maximum height above the head, then prepare to descend.
    - **Torso:** Aligns upright to stabilize posture during ascent.

    **7. Mid-Air Phase (Peak and Early Descent):**
    - **Time Interval:** t4.5 to t5
    - **Legs:** Start adjusting for landing by preparing to bend further at knees and hips.
    - **Arms:** Begin to lower from the highest point to regain balance and assist in landing.
    - **Torso:** Maintains upright posture, begins slight forward lean to prepare for landing impact.

    These additions provide specific instructions for what happens during the jump, ensuring each phase of the motion is captured and can be effectively animated.

    Upon further review, the descriptions provided all correspond well in terms of atomicity to the structured dance of motions involved in the action sequence. Each description focuses on specific body parts and their actions during concise time intervals. However, if any could be improved for even more preciseness, the **Landing Phase** stands out. This phase could potentially be split into two parts just like the mid-air phase to depict the initial contact and the follow-through of the landing.

    Hereâ€™s how this could be further divided for increased atomicity:

    **8. Initial Landing Contact:**
    - **Time Interval:** t5 to t5.5
    - **Legs:** Feet touch the ground with toes slightly ahead; begin bending knees to absorb impact.
    - **Arms:** Are in the downward motion to help balance the sudden deceleration.
    - **Torso:** Remains slightly forward leaning to distribute the impact.

    **9. Full Landing Stabilization:**
    - **Time Interval:** t5.5 to t6
    - **Legs:** Fully bent knees to absorb the remaining impact force, hips lower towards the heels.
    - **Arms:** Lowered and possibly move slightly backward to aid in final balancing.
    - **Torso:** Adjusts to a more upright position to stabilize the body fully.

    These additional specifics help clarify the landing process, showing the transition from impact to stabilization with distinct adjustments in body parts. Updating the overall sequence to include this added detail would ensure each portion of the motion is captured realistically for graphic animation programming.

    Upon reviewing the detailed atomic descriptions once again, each step does appear to cover specific actions for body parts within concise and well-defined time intervals, suggesting sufficient granularity for animation purposes in a computer graphics engine.

    Each step delineates actions and movements of legs, arms, and torso in tightly controlled time frames. However, if there is still room for refining atomicity or increasing granularity, one could argue that **Step 10: Return to Start Position** might be slightly less atomic compared to other steps. This description encapsulates the final positioning without explicitly detailing transitional movements for the body parts as they reset to the starting posture.

    Here are more detailed descriptions to make step 10 appropriately atomic:

    **10. Begin Return to Start Position:**
    - **Time Interval:** t6 to t6.5
    - **Legs:** Start straightening from the bent knee position.
    - **Arms:** Begin moving from a potentially lower or outward position back to resting by the sides.
    - **Torso:** Begins to shift from any forward-leaned or adjusted position back to a fully erect posture.

    **11. Complete Return to Start Position:**
    - **Time Interval:** t6.5 to t7
    - **Legs:** Fully straightened, stabilizing in the upright position.
    - **Arms:** Securely placed at the sides.
    - **Torso:** Fully erect, returning to the initial starting posture.

    Splitting the final return to start position into a beginning and completion phase ensures that each segment of this transition is explicitly noted, enhancing clarity and accuracy for the animation sequenceâ€”thereby matching the level of detail seen in the other phases.

    Upon careful review, the atomic descriptions provided for each phase of the action are precise, each detailing the movement of specific body parts within clear time intervals. Each description concentrates on the motion of the legs, arms, and torso during various, well-defined parts of the action sequence.

    Given these details, the descriptions currently align well with the concept of an "atomic" action that can be used as programmatic input into a computer graphics engine. Each stage has been split appropriately to ensure granularity that is finely tuned for realistic animations. Hence, none of the descriptions outlined in the list inherently lacks atomicity; they are all sufficiently detailed for animation purposes.

    To confirm, the information:
    - Is focused on specific parts of the body.
    - Addresses precise movements.
    - Includes clear timing intervals.
    - Separates each phase of motion uniquely and distinctly.

    If further granularity or adjustments are desired, they would likely pertain more to tuning parameters such as exact angles and speeds rather than further breaking down the descriptions. However, based on standard requirements for creating realistic animations via programmatic input, the current set of descriptions should be deemed adequately atomic.

    | t6.5 to t7    | Legs      | Fully straightened, stabilizing in the upright position.     |
    |               | Arms      | Securely placed at the sides.                                |
    |               | Torso     | Fully erect, returning to the initial starting posture.      |

    This tabular format offers a streamlined and structured view, simplifying the understanding of the sequence and easing the tasks of programming and animation by dividing the motion into comprehensible segments focused on specific time intervals and body parts.

- **Analysis**
    - When I ask the model to further recursively decompose the descriptions, I can get more fine-grained atomic generation.
    - Refinement into a table helps clearer representation.

- **Comments**
    - This example shows that if we keep asking the LLM, the LLM will gradually decompose the motion down to the level of joint and body part movements with precise angles and durations. Then the LLM will specify muscle tension, breath, nervous system, etc. We need to specify the expected granularity (body parts, joints, angles, durations, etc.) and which part more worthwhile to recursively decompose.
    - We might need to specify some simple pseudo-codes with args to denote some commonly used or generated contents, e.g., `START`, `RECURSION(arg)`, `FINISH`, etc. The current pure natural language based generation is too redundant.

    You will be given a high-level motion instruction. You will decompose this instruction down into a structured combination of atomic descriptions that can potentially serve as programmatic inputs into a computer graphics engine without substantive modification.

    There are two steps --- task planning and motion planning. In task planning, decompose the original motion instruction into several key procedures in natural language. In motion planning, decompose each key procedure into a structured series of atomic descriptions.

    An atomic description specifies the movement of a relevant body part in a certain time interval. For the movement, use **degree** as the movement unit and specify **the reference position or body part**. For the time interval, use **second** as the time unit. The format is {PERIOD}: {BODY_PART} ({REFERENCE_BODY_PART}) {START_DEGREE} -> {END_DEGREE}

    ### Task Planning
    **Task 1: Squat Down**
    1. Bend torso forward
    2. Bend both knees
    3. Lower hips
    4. Adjust arms for balance

    **Task 2: Jump**
    1. Extend legs
    2. Push off the ground with both feet
    3. Extend arms for momentum
    4. Land back on both feet and stabilize

    ### Motion Planning

    **Task 1: Squat Down**
    - **1. Bend torso forward**
        - 0-1s: torso (vertical) 0 -> 30
    - **2. Bend both knees**
        - 0-1s: right thigh (torso) 0 -> 90
        - 0-1s: left thigh (torso) 0 -> 90
        - 0-1s: right calf (right thigh) 0 -> 90
        - 0-1s: left calf (left thigh) 0 -> 90
    - **3. Lower hips**
        - Concurrent with knee bending
    - **4. Adjust arms for balance**
        - 0-1s: right upper arm (torso) 0 -> 30
        - 0-1s: left upper arm (torso) 0 -> 30
        - 0-1s: right forearm (right upper arm) 0 -> 45
        - 0-1s: left forearm (left upper arm) 0 -> 45

    **Task 2: Jump**
    - **1. Extend legs**
        - 1-2s: right thigh (torso) 90 -> 0
        - 1-2s: left thigh (torso) 90 -> 0
        - 1-2s: right calf (right thigh) 90 -> 0
        - 1-2s: left calf (left thigh) 90 -> 0
    - **2. Push off the ground with both feet**
        - 1-2s: right foot (right calf) 0 -> -45
        - 1-2s: left foot (left calf) 0 -> -45
    - **3. Extend arms for momentum**
        - 1-2s: right forearm (right upper arm) 45 -> 0
        - 1-2s: left forearm (left upper arm) 45 -> 0
        - 1-2s: right upper arm (torso) 30 -> 90
        - 1-2s: left upper arm (torso) 30 -> 90
    - **4. Land back on both feet and stabilize**
        - 2-3s: right foot (right calf) -45 -> 0
        - 2-3s: left foot (left calf) -45 -> 0
        - 2-3s: torso (vertical) 30 -> 0
        - 2-3s: right upper arm (torso) 90 -> 0
        - 2-3s: left upper arm (torso) 90 -> 0

- Comments
    - First task planning then motion planning helps overcome the problem of non-physical motions (e.g., squating without extending arms)
    - Specifying body parts and constraints greatly increases the well-formedness of generate answers
    - Adding comments after constraints help the model more deeply understand the directions of degrees
